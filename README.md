# Master-Thesis
My master thesis, where I investigated how to simulate Nanowire Resistive Random Access Memory Arrays. 

The main array model (Passive_array.py) is based on 
"Chen, An. "A comprehensive crossbar array model with solutions for line resistance and nonlinear device characteristics." IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices 60.4 (2013): 1318-1326.". 

The model Array_1T1R.py was developed by Karl-Magnus Persson at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, department of Electrical and Information Technology, and models a nanowire one-transistor-one-resistor cell by using a small signal model. This cell model is then integrated in the Passive_array model to simulate signal loss in a nanowire RRAM array.
